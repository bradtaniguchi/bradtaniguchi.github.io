# dynamic-app-builder

This project is **closed source** and was created for work.
It consisted of a SaaS no-code cloud based application.

This project was primarily written in Angular with a TypeScript back-end.

The key properties of this project was the large scale dynamic generation of different parts of the application so users can create their own applications all without any code.

## Technical contributions

I directly contributed to the architecture, automation pipeline, general operations and
significant portions of the server-side, database, and client-side codebase.
