Chrome extension that uses the [Asterank API](https://www.asterank.com/api).

Chrome Neo (Near Earth Object) extension. This extension utilizes the NeoWsService, API and Asterank API to access NASA's small body database. This extension provides a live feed of NEO, or Near-Earth-Objects for the current day, week, and month. You can also search NASA's small body database to get all available orbital parameters, as provided byt he Asterank API.

This application was created as a semester project for CSUDH, and is open sourced.
The goals of which were to create an application of some kind that combines CI/CD technologies and
automated testing. At the time the project used a travis-ci pipeline, which is now defunct.

This project is one of the projects that has been re-attempted a few times to replace this aging extension.
