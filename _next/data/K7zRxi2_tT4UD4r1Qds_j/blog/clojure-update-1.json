I wasn't trying to do much more than get an online clojure REPL I can use on my Pixelbook. Repl.it worked well, but I think its time I start working with more powerful tooling. Namely VSCode and Clava.</p>\n<p>To help with this, while also allowing me to still use my Pixelbook I'll be looking to migrate to codespaces on github.</p>\n<p>happy coding!</p>\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
