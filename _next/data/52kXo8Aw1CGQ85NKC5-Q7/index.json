one of the slightly annoying aspects of testing out this plugin is the fact you need an mssql installation locally and some \"hooking it up\" logic.

To enhance flexibility and integration with existing databases, it would be beneficial to allow developers to map these column names to custom names of their choosing.\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\n\r\n- Database Integration: Many applications need to integrate with pre-existing databases that may have different naming conventions or existing columns for session data.\r\n- Flexibility: Customizable column names can help avoid conflicts with other tables or columns in the database.\r\n- Consistency: Developers can maintain consistency in their database schema by aligning session table column names with their project's naming conventions.\r\n\r\nI know it might seem like a small thing, but I think it would be useful.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JLuboff/connect-mssql-v2/issues/74/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JLuboff/connect-mssql-v2/issues/74/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JLuboff/connect-mssql-v2/issues/comments/2392273296","html_url":"https://github.com/JLuboff/connect-mssql-v2/issues/74#issuecomment-2392273296","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/JLuboff/connect-mssql-v2/issues/74","id":2392273296,"node_id":"IC_kwDODRt2Hc6OlzGQ","user":{"login":"bradtaniguchi","id":10079147,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEwMDc5MTQ3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10079147?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradtaniguchi","html_url":"https://github.com/bradtaniguchi","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradtaniguchi/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradtaniguchi/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradtaniguchi/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradtaniguchi/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradtaniguchi/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradtaniguchi/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradtaniguchi/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradtaniguchi/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bradtaniguchi/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2024-10-03T20:27:56Z","updated_at":"2024-10-03T20:27:56Z","author_association":"COLLABORATOR","body":"@JLuboff
