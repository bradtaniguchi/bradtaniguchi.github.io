I also believe my new approach will help.</p>\n<p>This time I plan on <strong>not</strong> only relying on the book, instead I will use a multitude of sources to \"attack\" the problem from multiple angles. Furthermore, I also plan on leveraging a more \"active\" approach where I play around with the basic language syntax much more before moving on.</p>\n<p>Finally, I have a specific goal of creating a basic API in Clojure using in-memory. This goal might take a while to get to, but in the mean time I'll see how far I can get with basic Clojure.</p>\n<p>I'll try to post about my progress, or at a bare minimum post about my failures and if I give up in the end!</p>\n<p>happy coding!</p>\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
