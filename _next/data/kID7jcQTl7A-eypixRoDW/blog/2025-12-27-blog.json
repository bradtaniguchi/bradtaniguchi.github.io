Just like this blog, and the 2 versions before it, its also time to try out a new setup, and new focus with the new year.</p>\n<p>So this blog will go away and make way for a <strong>new</strong> one that removes the portfolio/project aspect, and focuses entirely around blog posts. With some of the original ideas I had for this one continuing.</p>\n<p>The other big change will be the framework used, this blog version has used <code>nextjs</code> with the goal of improving SEO with static site generation. The process was enlightening, but the next iteration will actually become simpler/more straight forward.</p>\n<p>The new version will actually use docusaurus as the main framework, with some underlying plugin code that I plan on writing to leverage dev.to to auto-cross post, with dev.to being the source of truth.</p>\n<p>There's no real reason for utilizing dev.to over other platforms, besides it seems like the simplest to leverage. With that, the next post (whenever it actually happens) will be in the next framework/iteration!</p>\n<p>I'll also carry over the previous posts into the new one with slight modifications.</p>\n<p>See ya there!</p>\n<p>Keep building, keep learning!</p>\n"},"__N_SSG":true}
