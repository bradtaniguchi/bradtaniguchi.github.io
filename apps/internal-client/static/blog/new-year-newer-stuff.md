# new-year-newer-stuff

Welcome to 2024!

I've slowed down working on my github profile, and any public projects. Work has been sucking up most of my "developer" energy, and I've had a lot going on in my personal life thats been taking up a lot of my time as well. Just not enough hours in the day!

The only project I've tried to stick with in my free time (besides this site/blog lol) is my [chrome-neo-plus](https://github.com/bradtaniguchi/chrome-neo-plus) project. This project has a "deadline" in that the [original](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chrome-neo/hggldlbbkkpnclkimhegjccgeaibeceg) will get removed from the chrome-extension store due to being on an older manifest. This deadline is **June**. I'm getting close with my new version and hope to get it out just in time, but we shall see!

The only big thing to note is I've gone back to practicing guitar again. I used to play back in high-school, but stopped once I went to college. Picking it back up is a nice way to take a break from screens and just relax. See if I'll be able to keep it up!

## Book update

I read a few more books to close out 2023. I read all of the ["silo" series](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silo_(series)>), which were great sci-fi reads. I don't have Apple TV so I wont be able to watch their show, but I'm sure its good.

I also read Old Man's War. I got it on sale, and it was a pretty entertaining read with a rather hilarious, but interesting premise. I'd consider it far less "hard sci-fi" than I usually ready but it was a light and easy book to fly through.

Finally I also read a physical book that I've had for a number of years and finally got around to reading it. [Delta-V](https://www.amazon.com/Delta-v-Daniel-Suarez/dp/1524742414). Was an interesting near-future read about near Earth asteroid mining.

Looking forward I think I'll read a few more non-fiction books before looking back into maybe picking up a full series of books, or continuing with Dune, which I paid for but just never felt like getting through.

Until next time, keep learning, keep building!
