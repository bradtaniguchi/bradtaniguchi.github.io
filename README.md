This repo represents my portfolio/blog site that is hosted on github-pages. It is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Nx](https://nx.dev/).

Today it represents the "latest" way I'd build a blog/portfolio site, but as with
most of my projects is unfinished and always a work in progress.
